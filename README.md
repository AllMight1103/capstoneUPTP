Introduction:
  Develop an ANPR system capable of detecting and bounding License Plates and use Transfer Learning to extend the model functionality to recognize the characters present in the license plate.
Objective:
  Obtain a robust model to apply it on character recognition in order to have precise results in ANPR.
